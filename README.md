# Python for Engineers and Scientists
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `Python for Engineers and Scientists`. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the main chapters in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the chapters in the course. The naming convention for the exercise notebooks is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#_TOPIC.ipynb`. These have a beginning and an end state; the end-state notebooks are marked as `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#_TOPIC-complete.ipynb`.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
